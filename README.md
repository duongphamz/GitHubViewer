# GitHubViewer
GitHubViewer is an administrative tool that allows browsing and viewing detailed information about users who are members of the GitHub site.

Key Features:
- User List: Administrators can browse through a list of users fetched from GitHub.
- Infinite Scrolling: Load more users' information seamlessly, with 20 items per fetch.
- Data Persistence: User information is cached locally, ensuring it loads instantly when the app is relaunched.
- User Details: Clicking on a user navigates to a detailed page with their specific information.

# Architecture Overview
GitHubViewer is built using Clean Architecture, ensuring modularity, scalability, and testability. The project consists of three main layers:

1. Domain Layer
The core layer that defines the application's business rules and entities.
Includes UseCases for defining what the application can do.
2. Data Layer
Implements the domain layerâ€™s contracts and handles the actual data operations.
Responsible for:
Fetching data from APIs.
Managing local storage (e.g., caching).
Abstracting away platform-specific details from the domain layer.
3. Presentation Layer
Handles UI and user interaction.
Uses the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern to bind data to the user interface.
In this project:
ViewModel handles presentation logic, such as receiving input from the view and transforming data models into display models.

# Technical Highlights
- Clean Architecture: Ensures separation of concerns and better maintainability.
- MVVM: Simplifies UI logic while keeping the views lightweight and reusable.
- Local Caching: Provides instant access to previously fetched data.
